                                                    <p>As Soviet Russia was desperately trying to recover after World War II the situation in the country changed. With the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, Nikita Krushchev took over the rule of the state. With this change, some leniencies came in terms of censorship and freedom of speech. This period is commonly referred to as Khrushchev Thaw.</p>
                                                    <p>Composers gained access to previously unavailable music and resources, they were able to experience the freedom of expression. This led to two groups emerging. One would create music that was nourished by the state and was supported by the Composers’ Union whilst another group would delve into more alternative, underground, unofficial music.</p>
                                                    <p>Many people believe that a Sixth World Youth Festival that took place in July 1957 in Moscow was a starting point of the diffusion of Western music and culture amongst Soviet youth. The Soviet government was terrified by the explosion of western culture in popularity and they started banning it. It was deemed immoral and Soviet press was actively involved in the anti-Western campaign.</p>
                                                    <p>The state had an iron grip on the record industry and it was impossible to get Western records, which have already sparked a demand. People had to get creative.</p>
                                                    <p>In 1946 a Polish man named Stanislaw Philo came to Leningrad and brought a trophy from war – a recording machine, which looked like a reverse gramophone. It would cut the grooves on the vinyl thus recording whichever sound was fed into it. He has opened a store where people could record their voice for fun. By night the store would turn into a bootleg music shop. But there was an issue. No-one could buy vinyl in the USSR to record on to. There was a creative fix for that problem - taking old x-ray photographs from hospitals, cutting them into circles and recording music onto them. However, the underground recording studio was discovered and everybody involved in the business was arrested. </p>

                                                    <p>In the early 1960s, the Soviet press ridiculed the Beatles, saying that they were superficial idols and they were soon to cease to exist. A certain amount of leniency allowed Soviet media to cover Western music, even though the tone was hostile.</p>
                                                    <p>The demand for the coverage of foreign music became enormous. Youth magazines were writing about foreign groups, translating their songs. As the State was monitoring everything, those texts were anti-Western, but even such coverage would still give some information about foreign music.</p>
                                                    <p>Because of the virtual inaccessibility of original sources, writers would commonly misinterpret lyrics on purpose, thus trying to portray Western music as an anti-State plot.</p>
                                                    <p>“Despite the earnest efforts of the Communist propagandists to dissuade Soviet youth from the interest in foreign rock music, these countermeasures had precisely the opposite effect. The magazines and newspapers that contained any, however critical and disapproving, information regarding Western hard rock and heavy metal, would instantly disappear from the newsstands and enjoyed high demand in public libraries. The young fans of underground music would find ways to get around the inaccessibility of photocopy technology to ordinary citizens by finding alternative ways of information circulation. Whenever an article featured a photograph of the group, said photographs would be widely duplicated by means of photographing the printed image, with the resulting faux simile black and white photos subsequently sold for a ruble each in school hallways and collectors swap meets.” Von Faust</p>

                                                    <p>The signing of the Helsinki Accord in 1975 was a diplomatic agreement, the purpose of which was to improve relationships between the Communist East and the capitalist West. This allowed for the exploration of each other’s cultures.</p>
                                                    <p>During the late 70s, the only Soviet music recording label Melodia secured a certain number of licenses and released state-approved records of Western musicians, thus officially bringing western music into the country. But the state music industry failed to meet the demand of local music fans and the extensive network of black-market records emerged.</p>
                                                    <p>People would gather in remote areas or fields and passionately discuss music and exchange records. The location would constantly change, but it didn’t stop the police from constantly raiding those gathering and punishing those who were caught.</p>
                                                    <p>“Despite the most earnest efforts of numerous Soviet official organizations, the country’s youth continuously developed a countercultural heritage that contradicted the dogmas of the dominant Communist social structure. Bypassing the official avenues, Western recordings and periodicals found their way to the eager consumers through elaborate contraband networks, swap-meet exchanges, and clandestine transactions. Over the course of the Cold War, the influence of Western counterculture on the Soviet youth grew throughout the nation, with even the underground forms of Western music gaining mass popularity on a scale that the official Kremlin often found threatening to the very foundations of “proletarian” culture and ideology.” Von Faust</p>

                                                    <p>In the early 1980s, Konstantin Chernenko ascended as the ideological head of the Soviet government. He was convinced that “through rock, the enemy is trying to exploit youthful psychology”. He launched an enormous assault against the Soviet youth’s counterculture in July 1983. In his speech, he said that Western music is poisoning the minds of Soviet people. He accused media in failing to combat new temptations of the youth scene. He ordered police to be going out and patrolling the discotheques and concerts in order to control the type of music being played.</p>
                                                    <p>In the same month, he has also released an order for mandatory registration and approval of all domestic amateur bands. Music produced by them had to consist of texts and melodies written by the State’s Union of Composers, thus limiting their creative output.</p>
                                                    <p>The attack against Western culture in media continued. In the absence of independent media, people have turned to samizdat – unsanctioned and illegal writing made to combat the ideas against Western culture imposed by the state. Despite the fact that the production of such fanzines took a long time and it was hard to distribute them, the demand was huge. Vast underground networks of distribution for samizdat were created very quickly by enthusiasts.</p>
                                                    <p>Ban Lists became another consequence of Chernenko’s doctrine. Lists of foreign bands were made listing the reasons why they are inappropriate. Even though they were made for internal use only, they have managed to reach the public and the police were using them as a guide and were punishing those possessing records by named artists. That led to a spree of arrests where people were punished disproportionately harshly. Some were imprisoned for years, others were admitted to mental hospitals where they were administered the same drugs as patients suffering from schizophrenia. Despite all of the above Soviet youth continued to enjoy forbidden music and culture. They refused to surrender.</p>
                                                    <p>Konstantin Chernenko died in 1985. Mikhail Gorbachev became the General Secretary of the party in the same year. He has introduced a new political direction which started with the relaxation of censorship. Editorial staff finally received the freedom of speech. Even though changes were being made, the prosecution of overly open writers continued for several years onwards.</p>
                                                    <p>Towards the end of the decade, rock music was steadily entering Soviet culture. Media has dramatically increased the coverage of the Western music scene to meet the rising demand.</p>
                                                    <p>Soviet people knew that things were moving in the right direction, when in December 1987 Uriah Heep, British hard rock veterans, became the first-ever hard rock band to perform in the USSR. But perhaps the biggest approval of Western music was a festival “Moscow Music Peace Festival” which took place in Moscow in 1989.</p>

Mourning society was strongly influenced by war since a few generations of men were taking roles in World War I and II. The United Kingdom had to stand up on their feet again to recover in every possible way; economically and culturally. After years of war, demand for something new and fresh grew. People needed to be entertained in order to recover.</p>
                                                    <p>In 1953, everyone's attention was drawn to the new, young queen Queen Elizabeth II. Although newspapers and radio were the main sources of news spread, TV sets found a way to almost every Briton home, since her majesty’s coronation was televised for the very first time in British monarchies history.</p>
                                                    <p>The national broadcaster, the BBC, started releasing different forms of entertainment,such as comedies and dramas - The Goon Show, Under Milk Wood and Dick Barton Special Agent.</p>
                                                    <p>Although Britain as a country and empire was multicultural, foreign music was only accessible via foreign radio, like Radio Luxembourg.</p>
                                                    <p>Little did they know then, UK acts became iconic all over the whole world and influenced many different artists today.</p>

                                                    <p>Transformation in the UK, especially in London, was fast. The generation who spent their youth in war, wanted their children to live their lives and enjoy their youth, meaning the post-war generation would be very different from the one before.</p>
                                                    <p>Music took a huge role in social and cultural lives, young people started fighting for their identity, causing the growth of creativity and the emergence of new bands like The Beatles, Rolling Stones, The Kinks, The Animals and many others.</p>
                                                    <p>Young people were experimenting with their wardrobe, ideas, political opinions and drugs. Recreational drug use played a huge part in the 60s music scene in Britain. Many artists discovered different kinds of creativity under the influence of drugs, like LSD. Hit records from The Beatles, like Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds, Strawberry Fields Forever, Across The Universe and many more created controversies and were the start of a rock music style called psychedelic rock. The early examples of this style of rock and roll are The Beatles album The Magical Mystery Tour.</p>
                                                    <p>The Beatles album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is one of the most influential albums, which inspired many musicians, like Gary Barlow, Lady Gaga and even The Rolling Stones.</p>
                                                    <p>Although the United Kingdom was not involved in the Vietnam war, John Lennon was a pioneer of peace and stated his clear opinion against it. It was not usual for musicians to state his opinions about politics at the time. John Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono tried to draw attention to this issue by music and used their fame to spread it further. Even to this day, a song like Give Peace A Chance and Imagine acts like a hymn for peace and hope. Together with his wife, John Lennon spent his honeymoon in bed, promoting peace and talking to the reporters about the issues, that the war causes and innocent lives that are lost during it.</p>

                                                    <p>British Invasion is a phenomenon that first occurred in the mid-60s. Whilst bands earned their fame at home, the actual goal was to get big across the Atlantic, which would guarantee success and worldwide fame. Life magazine from 1964 opens up saying “In 1776 England lost her American colonies. Last week the Beatles took them back.” The Beatles took over US charts starting with the first British Invasion and Beatlemania. Many other artists followed up and also earned their fame in the US, like The Rolling Stones, The Animals, The Kinks, The Who, The Zombies and a bunch of others.</p>
                                                    <p>In 1982, British band Human League released their hit “Don’t You Want Me” and stormed to the U.S. The song stayed at the top of Billboard’s Hot 100 for three weeks straight starting off a Second British Invasion. Almost 20 years later, British bands were at the top of the charts, starting with The Police, Depeche Mode and others like Pet Shop Boys Culture Club, Depeche Mode, Def Leppard, Eurythmics, The Human League, Billy Idol, Thompson Twins,  Elvis Costello</p>
                                                    <p>Besides their fame, The Beatles had their downs. Probably, the most famous one was John Lennon's statement in one of their interviews on the 4th of March, 1966. John Lennon mocked Christianity saying ”Christianity will go, it will vanish and shrink, we’re more popular than Jesus now.” The quote became big only 5 years later when the U.S caught it. This is one of the biggest scandals that The Beatles were involved in and their US audience were not as crazy about the band as they used to be.</p>
                                                    <p>This statement led to a lot of anger from the public, and people started breaking books, records and other Beatles merchandise in the streets. Massive protests were held in order to express anger towards the band. Later, John Lennon defended his position in one of the interviews saying ‘…it was a long time ago, I just didn’t mean what everybody thinks I meant. I am not antichrist or anti-religion or anti-god…”. Although their popularity in the USA dropped dramatically, it did not stop the band from creating more legendary tracks and albums, they followed up with albums like Revolver, The Beatles White Album and Abbey Road.</p>

                                                    <p>The Punk movement emerged in the United Kingdom and became a trend in the early 70s. Punk as a subculture began as a movement against the music, style and idealism of the hippie movement.</p>
                                                    <p>The icon of the British punk is probably band Sex Pistols. Members of the band were creating controversial tracks mocking and shaming politics in the UK. Probably the most popular track is God Save The Queen. Whilst using the name of the UK anthem wasn’t enough, the band expressed extreme disrespect toward UK politics and questioned monarchy in their lyrics. The timing was also not so great; the song was released in 1977, during Queen Elizabeth’s silver jubilee.</p>
                                                    <p>They paid their price, Sex Pistol members were caught on the streets and beaten up for their track and had to stand up against the public’s rage in general. Although it was banned by BBC then, today, it is considered to be one of the greatest songs of all time and acts as a monument to human rights and freedom of speech.</p>
