                        <p>The USSR had a long and convoluted history which started with an October revolution in 1917 when Bolsheviks took over the power from Bourgeoisie and ended in Dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Those were very hard times that went on for almost 80 years. Some people remember parts of that time fondly, although many dread the thought of life during Soviet rule.</p>
                        <p>The USSR was under the strict rule of the state, where people’s freedom of choice and speech was very limited. Media was censored, everything foreign was considered inappropriate. </p>
                        <p>The USSR's state apparatus responsible for the censorship would closely examine each and every single thing coming from abroad and needless to say that most of the songs would be banned due to a number of alleged forbidden topics such as violence, vandalism and perversion.</p>
                        <p>That meant that the popular music created outside the USSR to be enjoyed by everybody became a sought after commodity and an illegal form of freedom for those behind the Iron Curtain.</p>
                        <p>People were going to great lengths to try and get their hands on those forbidden music records. It was illegal at the time to leave the country without special permission as the border was closed. Those lucky ones who were selected and allowed to do business abroad would tell stories about the different life and music scene abroad as well as sometimes smuggling in some of the Western records. Those were kept in secret as mere possession of such records could mean a lifetime in prison for their owners.</p>
                        <p>Another way of bringing foreign music was rather fascinating. People would cut vinyl records out of their old x-ray photos and would record music onto those. Needless to say, the quality of such records was poor, but it was good enough for those rebelling against the state.</p>
                        <p>Despite the fact that the UK was one of the winners of WWII, it was economically and socially bruised like the rest of the world. People were tired of war horrors and were on the way to recovery. They wanted to live free lives. After the nation’s beloved Winston Churchill was elected to rule the country, democratic freedom and human rights were in place. People of the United Kingdom had freedom of speech and expression. Young people were experimenting with everything and in the following decades the UK became one of the largest music hotspot, with such legendary bands like The Beatles. </p>
